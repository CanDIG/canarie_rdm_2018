Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan
===================================


> Describe any risks (including non-HR risks) that could reasonably arise during development, and outline a mitigation strategy for each risk.

Software Provenance
===================

> Please address the following questions:
> 
> Who would authorize software releases? 
> What validation procedures would be completed prior to release?
> What documents would be provided as part of the release package?
> How would you deal with upgrades / patches to third party software packages that you might use?



Testing Plan
============

> CANARIE strongly encourages the use of dedicated software testing resources. Outline how you intend to test your software to ensure it:
> meets the requirements that guided its design and development
> is usable and performs its intended function(s)
> can be installed and run in its intended environment

The CanDIG project uses Travis-CI to perform unit testing of its individual components, and as the number of services increases, is moving towards a combination of CircleCI and Jenkins for integration tests of the services.

For the 




User Training Plan
==================

> How do you intend to train / onboard new users?


Maintenance and Support Plan
============================

> Outline your maintenance and support plan for the proposed software post CANARIE funding. Include your plans for:
>
> operations 
> software maintenance
> providing user support
> extending / adding functionality
> facilitating adoption by new users

Intellectual Property
=====================

> How do you intend to manage any intellectual property arising from this proposed project?

> Please note: Should commercialization of the IP take place, royalties will be required to accrue 
> to CANARIE to repay some or all of the contribution, and a royalty agreement will be required.
