Mandatory Criteria:
===================

CHORD is a project to build a federated, Canadian, national data
service for privacy-sensitive genomic and related health data.

**1. How does the proposed software make use of Canadian digital infrastructure**

By providing an inherently federated approach to the analysis of 
Canadian health genomic and related data, CHORD builds on the
investments behind Canada's National Education and Research Network
for high-speed, low-latency availability of queries and intermediate
results.

In addition, the computational and storage at the participating
sites (MUQGIC, HPC4Health, and the BCGSC), will be the backbone
upon which initial CHORD servces are provided.

**2. Explain how the proposed project contributes to one or more of CANARIE’s expected results**

CHORD will judiciously unlock silos of privacy-sensitive genomic
and related health data, allowing their joint analyses over the
CANARIE network in a federated fashion.

In doing so, CHORD will contribute to CANARIE's expected result
(a) by relying fundamentally on the maintenence and continued
development of the CANARIE to spur entirely new collaborative
knowledge creation that results from the ability to analyze national-scale
health data sets across silos.

CHORD will also contribute to CANARIE's expected result (b) by
increasing the research community's utilization of the CANARIE
network by making it safe and feasible to make privacy-sensitive
health omics data available for analysis across the NREN while
strictly limiting direct access.

**3. Please provide information to support that the software development
proposed is technologically and economically viable in the timeframe of
the project plan.**


**4. All funded work must be performed in Canada. Please identify the
locations(s) at which the funded work would be performed.**

The funded work will be performed at:
* McGill University, Montréal
* The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto
* University Health Network, Toronto
* Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver

**5. The Lead Contractor must be a Canadian university, college,
corporation or other legally recognized entity. Please provide the
organization’s URL.**

https://www.mcgill.ca

**6. No more than half of the membership and Board of Directors of the
Lead Contractor can be composed of representatives or agents of the
federal government. Please provide a list of Board members or provide
the list via the relevant URL.**

https://www.mcgill.ca/boardofgovernors/membership

**7. In-Kind contributions must be at least 15% of total eligible
project costs.** 

**CONFIRMED **

**8. Software developed under CANARIE funding must be made available for
other researchers to use at no cost, through the CANARIE Research
Software Registry** **at:
[*https://science.canarie.ca/*](http://science.canarie.ca/researchmiddleware/services/list/main.html)
for a period of 3 years from the end of the funding period. **

**CONFIRMED**
