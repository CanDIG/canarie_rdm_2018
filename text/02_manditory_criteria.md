# Mandatory Criteria:

CHORD is a project to build a federated, Canadian, national data
service for privacy-sensitive genomic and related health data.

**1. How does the proposed software make use of Canadian digital infrastructure**

By providing an inherently federated approach to the analysis of 
Canadian health genomic and related data, CHORD builds on the
investments behind Canada's National Education and Research Network
for high-speed, low-latency availability of queries and intermediate
results.

In addition, the computational and storage at the participating
sites (MUQGIC, HPC4Health, and the BCGSC), will be the backbone
upon which initial CHORD services are provided.

**2. Explain how the proposed project contributes to one or more of CANARIE’s expected results**

CHORD will judiciously unlock silos of privacy-sensitive genomic
and related health data, allowing their joint analyses over the
CANARIE network in a federated fashion.

In doing so, CHORD will contribute to CANARIE's expected result
(a) by relying fundamentally on the maintenance and continued
development of the CANARIE to spur entirely new collaborative
knowledge creation that results from the ability to analyze national-scale
health data sets across silos.

CHORD will also contribute to CANARIE's expected result (b) by
increasing the research community's utilization of the CANARIE
network by making it safe and feasible to make privacy-sensitive
health omics data available for analysis across the NREN while
strictly limiting direct access.

**3. Please provide information to support that the software development
proposed is technologically and economically viable in the timeframe of
the project plan.**

In this document, we describe a plan for development of CHORD
services which is conservatively scoped for the 18-month duration
of this proposal.  The CanDIG project is considering more open-ended,
methods development tasks in other contexts, but the work described
in this document consists entirely of developing well understood
functionality that has been successful elsewhere, with the novelty
being the integration and presentation to Canadian researchers as
as a service.

Internally, we are confident in our effort estimates for individual
services.  The CanDIG project has now accumulated significant
experience in developing front end genomics services and developing
the back end to support them.  Using an API-first approach and our
Go and Python frameworks, several prototype and production services
have now been developed, both by permanent staff and co-op students;
with significant front-loaded investment in API design, the process
has been uniformly straightforward.

As is also described in the risk mitigation section, we have developed
our plan so that there is only loose coupling between activities, so
that significant delays in any one task would not irretrievably delay
others.

Finally, confidence in the feasibility of the (novel) integration
of these activities into a coherent, functioning service comes from
related activities in genomic projects elsewhere, where similar
services-based approaches for genomic data processing has been
successful.  Here, CanDIG's integration with a global community
of practice benefits the CHORD project, as project members have
access to collaborators building related projects internationally.

**4. All funded work must be performed in Canada. Please identify the
locations(s) at which the funded work would be performed.**

The funded work will be performed at:
* McGill University, Montréal
* The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto
* University Health Network, Toronto
* Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver

**5. The Lead Contractor must be a Canadian university, college,
corporation or other legally recognized entity. Please provide the
organization’s URL.**

https://www.mcgill.ca

**6. No more than half of the membership and Board of Directors of the
Lead Contractor can be composed of representatives or agents of the
federal government. Please provide a list of Board members or provide
the list via the relevant URL.**

https://www.mcgill.ca/boardofgovernors/membership

**7. In-Kind contributions must be at least 15% of total eligible
project costs.** 

**CONFIRMED**

**8. Software developed under CANARIE funding must be made available for
other researchers to use at no cost, through the CANARIE Research
Software Registry** 

**CONFIRMED**
